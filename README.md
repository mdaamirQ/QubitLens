This repository implements a quantum state tomography method using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to reconstruct quantum states from measurement samples. It includes visualization tools for Bloch spheres and fidelity between true and reconstructed states.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `qutip` - For Bloch sphere visualization
- `ipywidgets` - For interactive widgets
- `plotly` - For advanced plotting
- `numpy` - For numerical operations
- `scipy` - For optimization and statistical functions
- `matplotlib` - For basic plotting

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
